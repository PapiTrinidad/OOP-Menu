<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Kevin Trinidad-Castillo</h1>
<h3 align="center">I was asked to create a menu purely of javascript where I used Object Oriented Programming for a menu. 
  In the javascript I am able to create, remove, and view the different food items listed there. With the help of classes I was able to do so and further my understanding of ES6.
  I used HTML and Javascript for the files you see, the meat and potatoes of this small project is various methods I used to achieve a step forward into my career as a developer. 
  The hardest part of the project was the removing, I had to spend hours to figure out something that would work for me.</h3>
